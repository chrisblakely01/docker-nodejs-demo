# Docker Node.js Demo

Welcome to the Docker Node.js Demo repository for my YouTube course! This repository contains the code for a comprehensive course on Docker and Docker Compose, focusing on building and managing microservices with Node.js. The course is divided into four parts, each available on a separate branch.

## Table of Contents

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
- [How to Get Part-1 Starter Code](#how-to-get-part-1-starter-code)
- [How to Get Part-2 Starter Code](#how-to-get-part-2-starter-code)
- [How to Get Part-3 Starter Code](#how-to-get-part-3-starter-code)
- [How to Get Part-4 Starter Code](#how-to-get-part-4-starter-code)
- [Contributing](#contributing)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** Ensure you have the latest version of Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **IDE:** Preferably Visual Studio Code, which you can download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Terminal:** A Unix-based terminal (e.g., macOS Terminal, Git Bash, or WSL for Windows users).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:chrisblakely01/docker-nodejs-demo.git
cd docker-nodejs-demo
```

## How to Get Part-1 Starter Code

To get the starter code for Part-1, switch to the `part-1` branch:

```bash
git checkout part-1
```

This branch contains the initial setup for the course, including creating Docker images and containers.

## How to Get Part-2 Starter Code

To get the starter code for Part-2, switch to the `part-2` branch:

```bash
git checkout part-2
```

This branch builds on Part-1 and covers using Docker Compose to manage multiple containers.

## How to Get Part-3 Starter Code

To get the starter code for Part-3, switch to the `part-3` branch:

```bash
git checkout part-3
```

In this part, you will learn about running Nginx and setting up networking between containers.

## How to Get Part-4 Starter Code

To get the starter code for Part-4, switch to the `part-4` branch:

```bash
git checkout part-4
```

This final part includes managing databases within Docker and advanced networking concepts.
